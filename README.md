# AI/ML Guild Lab 1

In this lab we'll learn about Python, Jupyter notebooks and a basic Machine 
Learning algorithm. 

## Getting Started

Install Python if necessary, follow the steps for your OS. 
<https://www.python.org>

* Start the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
  * Note: this activate file is shell specific, you may need to start the one 
  for your shell, e.g., `activate.ps1`, `activate.csh`, `activate.fish`
* Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Start the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`

This should open the Lab1 notebook in your browser.
